                               Unit 11 - Compiler II - Code Generation
                               ---------------------------------------

Submitted Files
---------------
1. Main.py - The main file running this code. The script can be given either a path of a JACK file,
             or a path to a directory containing multiple JACK files.

2. CompilationEngine.py - A class representing the full JACK language compiler. The class is initialized with
                          a path to one JACK file, and creates an VM file containing the complied jack code.

3. JackTokenizer.py - A class which receives a string representing the pure jack code and tokenizes it.
                      Allows advancing through the tokens one at a time.

4. JackFileReader.py - A class which receives a path to a given JACK file and turns it in to a string containing only
                    the pure jack code - without comments, redundant white spaces and documentation.

5. Syntax.py - A help class containing several regexs and arrays used by the CompilationEngine class.

6. SymbolTable.py - A symbol table that associates names with information needed for Jack compilation:
                type, kind, and running index. The symbol table has 2 nested scopes (class/subroutine).

7. VMWriter.py - Emits VM commands into a file
