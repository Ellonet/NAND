README - This file. A description of the project
Fill.asm : The program runs an infinite loop that listens to the keyboard input. 
		   When a key is pressed (any key), the program blackens the screen as long as the key is pressed. 
		   When no key is pressed, the program clears the screen.
mult.asm : With this terminology in mind, this program computes the value R0*R1 and stores the result in R2.
Divide.asm : this program computes the value R13/R14 and stores the result in R15.
Sort.asm : The program sorts the array starting at the address in R14 with length as specified in R15.
		   The sort is in descending order - the largest number at the head of the array.
