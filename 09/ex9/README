Remarks
-------
We chose to implement a "Hungry basket" game. The player can control the basket and move it left and right.
The player has to catch as many fruits as possible, while avoiding the bombs.
Each fruit is worth 1 point. 
Each bomb hit results in 1 life lost and 2 points lost. 
If the player earns 10 points without being hit by the bomb - he earns 1 life.

The game will end if the player wins (earns 50 points), loses (0 lives) or presses q.

we hope you like it!
